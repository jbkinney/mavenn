    "Each MAVE dataset is represented a set of $N$ observations, $\\set{(\\vec{x}_n,y_n)}_{n=1}^N$, where each observation consists of a sequence $\\vec{x}_n$ and a measurement $y_n$. Here, $y_n$ can be either a continuous real-valued number, or a categorical variable representing the bin in which the $n$th sequence was found. Note that, in this representation the same sequence $\\vec{x}$ can be observed multiple times, potentially with different values for $y$ due to experimental noise. Datasets with real-valued measurements $y$ are analyzed using GE regression, while datasets with categorical $y$ values are analyzed using MPA regression. Sets of measurements are denoted $\\set{y_n}$, etc., and the mean and standard deviations of sets of numbers are denoted by the functions $\\mean(\\set{\\cdot})$ and $\\std(\\set{\\cdot})$\n",

These degrees of freedom come in two flavors: gauge modes and diffeomorphic modes. Gauge modes are changes to $\\vec{\\theta}$ that do not alter the values of the latent phenotype $\\phi$. Diffeomorphic modes (Kinney & Atwal, 2014; Atwal & Kinney, 2016) are changes to $\\vec{\\theta}$ that do alter $\\phi$, but do so in ways that can be undone by transformations of the measurement process $p(y|\\phi)$ along corresponding \"dual modes\". As shown in (Kinney & Atwal, 2014), the diffeomorphic modes of linear G-P maps like those considered here will in general correspond to affine transformations of $\\phi$ (though there are exceptions at special values of $\\vec{\\theta}$). MAVE-NN fixes both gauge modes and diffeomorphic modes before providing parameter values or other access to model internals to the user, e.g. when ``model.get_theta()`` is called. \n",

    "### Variational information\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes useful to consider a quantity we call the \"variational information\", $I_\\var[y;\\phi]$, which is an affine transformation of $\\mathcal{L}_\\var$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    I_\\var[y;\\phi] = H[y] - \\frac{\\log_2(e)}{N}\\mathcal{L}_\\like.\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $H[y]$ is the entropy of the data $\\set{y_n}$, which is estimated using the $k$'th nearest neighbor (kNN) estimator from the NPEET package \\cite{VanSteeg:2014aa}. Noting that this quantity can also be written as $I_\\var[y;\\phi] = H[y] - \\mean(\\set{Q_n})$ where $Q_n = -\\log_2 p(y_n|\\phi_n)$, we estimate the associated uncertainty using \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\delta I_\\var[y;\\phi] = \\sqrt{\\delta H[y]^2 + \\var(\\set{Q_n})/N}.\n",
    "\\end{equation} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Likelihood information quantifies the mutual information between $\\phi$ and $y$ assuming that the inferred measurement process $p(y|\\phi)$ is correct. We therefore propose $I_\\var \\pm \\delta I_\\var$ as a diagnostic for model fitting and performance, as it is directly comparable to the predictive information of the model, $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$. Indeed, when both are evaluated on test data, the fit information provides an approximate lower-bound on a model's predictive information. \n",

    "### Predictive information\n",
    "The predictive information $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$, when computed on data not used for training, provides a measure of how strongly a G-P map predicts experimental measurements irrespective of the corresponding measurement process. To estimate this quantity we use k'th nearest neighbor (kNN) estimators of entropy and mutual information adapted from the NPEET Python package (VanSteeg, 2014). Here, the user has the option of adjusting $k$, which controls a variance/bias tradeoff. When $y$ is discrete (MPA regression), $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$ is computed using the classic kNN entropy estimator (Vasicek, 1976; Kraskov et al., 2004) via the decomposition $I_\\pred[y;\\phi] = H[\\phi] - \\sum_y p(y) H_y[\\phi]$, where $H_y[\\phi]$ denotes the entropy of $p(\\phi|y)$. When $y$ is continuous (GE regression), $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$ is estimated using the kNN-based KSG algorithm (Kraskov et al, 2004). This approach optionally supports a local nonuniformity correction of (Gao et al., 2014), which is important when $y$ and $\\phi$ exhibit strong dependencies, but which also requires substantially more time to compute. We emphasize that both estimates of $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$ make no use of the measurement process $p(y|\\phi)$ inferred by MAVE-NN. \n",

    "### Uncertainties in kNN estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "MAVE-NN quantifies uncertainties in $H[y]$ and $I[y;\\phi]$ using multiple random samples of half the data. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{100\\%}$ denote a full dataset, and let $\\mathcal{D}_{50\\%,r}$ denote a 50\\% subsample (indexed by $r$) of this dataset. Given an estimator $E(\\cdot)$ of either entropy or mutual information, as well as the number of subsamples $R$ to use, the uncertainty in $E(\\mathcal{D}_{100\\%})$ is estimated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\delta E(\\mathcal{D}_{100\\%}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\std \\left[\\set{E(\\mathcal{D}_{50\\%,r})}_{r=0}^{R-1} \\right].\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By default MAVE-NN uses $R=25$. We note that computing such uncertainty estimates substantially increase computation time, as $E(\\cdot)$ needs to be evaluated $R+1$ times instead of just once. We also note that boostrap resampling is not advisable in this context, as it systematically underestimates $H[y]$ and overestimates $I[y;z]$ (data not shown)."
